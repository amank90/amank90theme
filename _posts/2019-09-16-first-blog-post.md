It was an interesting first week at UBC. The lectures in first week covered mostly the basic concept of probability and statictics and programming in python. But I think subjects will really get complex soon.

We have covered majorly four subjects so far.

* Communication and Argumentation
* Probability and Statistics
* Computation Platform
* Programming

We also have corresponding lab for each lecture where we complete the assigments given and discuss the problems mention in the lab work.
